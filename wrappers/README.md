Spokes Wrapper
==============

Spokes Wrapper is a source code sample that presents simplified API for
use with Plantronics Spokes Software.

The C# version is fairly feature complete.
There are Spokes 2.8 and Spokes 3.x versions available.

The C++ version is not as complete and currently only Spokes 2.8
But offers call control and mute sync functionality. Some advance
Contextual Intelligence features are not tested yet and may not be
fully implemented.
(A Spokes 3.x version of C++ Spokes Wrapper is in the works)
