<li></li>
<li>It's purpose is to make it easier and simpler to integrate support for Plantronics devices into any applications.</li>
<li></li>
<li>It achieves this by hiding a lot of the more tricky aspects of integration behind the wrapper and presenting</li>
<li>a simple and consistent set of Event Handlers and functions for the core features of the SDK that the user</li>
<li>will typically be needing.</li>

<li>NOTE: you are advised NOT to use headset buttons e.g. talk button for</li>

<li>and CallAnswered/CallEnded event handlers. Using talk button will</li>
<li>cause problems with multiline devices as talk button events for the</li>
